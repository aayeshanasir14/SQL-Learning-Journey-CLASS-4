In Class 4, I took my SQL learning a step further by exploring conditional statements using the WHERE clause, which helped me understand how to retrieve specific data from large datasets efficiently. This class was highly practical and focused on refining query-writing skills with real-world examples.

âœ… Topics Covered

Applying the WHERE clause to filter records based on specific conditions

Using AND, OR, and NOT operators for complex conditional queries

Implementing IN, BETWEEN, and NULL/NOT NULL conditions

Understanding how logical operators affect data retrieval

Writing multiple types of queries for flexible data filtering

ðŸ’» Practical Focus

Created a database named ORGANIZATION

Designed a table MEMBERS_ORG with fields: ID, Name, Age, City, and JoinDate

Inserted multiple records into the table using the INSERT INTO statement

Executed various conditional queries to:

Retrieve members based on age, name, or city

Combine multiple conditions using AND and OR

Exclude data using NOT

Filter data within a range using BETWEEN

Handle null values effectively

ðŸ“Š Learning Outcome

This session enhanced my ability to query and analyze data using conditions in SQL. I gained a clear understanding of how logical operators influence results and how to extract precise information from databases. The hands-on exercises significantly improved my confidence in writing professional and efficient SQL queries for data management and reporting.
